			<h2>C.E.O's Message</h2>
			<p>Dear Parents,</p>

            <p>Over the last decade or so the world has seen a tremendous change, growth and use of technology in every field. Similarly Education has also undergone a rapid change in the process. Technology has given wide and huge dimensions to enhance the teaching-learning Processes. The journey from the ancient Gurukula system to the modern day class-Rooms is worth rewinding. Value based education coupled with the Academic Excellence in children has now become the mantra in education. Every person now wants to learn as many skills as possible in the shortest time. That means at school we have to work with children in such a way so as to develop positive skills which will enable them to learn the maximum skills.</p>
			
			<p>The Yashas Institutions stands out uniquely among all other schools where every child is viewed as an individual with unique potential and opportunities are provided at every stage in school for the child to discover his/her potential. The struggles and strives of the modern world and its uncertainties makes it imperative that education not only ennobles them and makes them good citizens of tomorrow, it also makes them men of character, value and tradition. Education breeds confidence, Confidence breeds hope and hope breeds peace. Schooling must be a wonderful experience and the school must provide a platform for it. I would like to focus on the USP of our school. ‘Care and Nurture’ caring for every individual and nurturing the innate potential of every child. Let us join hands in making education the most powerful weapon we can use to change the world for a better tomorrow.</p>

			<h2>SECRETARY's Message</h2>
			<p>Yashas Vidya Kendra, is an institution that focuses on excellence in scholastic and Co-Scholastics aspects of the child’s personality. Academics has been and will continue to be our first priority. We are very fortunate to have an outstanding faculty and support staff, who work diligently to realize the vision of all round excellence.</p>

            <p>Our motto, “Learn, Achieve and Inspire” captures the essence of our spirit. In our school, children gain an all-round education and achieve their potential not just in the academic field but also in the field of sports and creative arts.</p>
			
			<p>Each child is different. We, as educators offer and provide opportunities to each of the individual to bring out the best in them. It is said that a leader is born with the birth of every child. The need is to provide an enabling environment and careful nurturing to the diverse talented children under our care.</p>
			
			<p>I believe that a good school celebrates its past, enjoys its present and imagines its future. But a great school challenges the students to be actively involved in all these things for themselves; this is what we do at Yashas Institutions.</p>
